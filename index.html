                        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto"><p class="large">I am R. Steven Randolph and I am a Republican candidate for Putnam County General Sessions Court Judge, Part II. I have lived in Putnam County my entire life. Bobby Dean Randolph (deceased) and Sandra Wilson Randolph are my parents. They have owned several businesses throughout their lives, but they are best known for being the original owners and operators of the Algood Diner. In addition, Bobby Dean Randolph previously served on the Algood city council.</p></div>
                        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto"><p class="large">I graduated from Cookeville High School in 1991, with honors. I graduated Tennessee Technological University in 1995 with an Associate of Applied Science degree in Criminal Justice and a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology. Upon graduation from TTU in 1995, I began law school at the Nashville School of Law. While studying law at night, I worked during the day with juveniles. I worked as a residential rehabilitation therapist at the Adolescent Diagnostic and Evaluation Center (A.D.E.C.) located at Plateau Mental Health Center. Later, I worked at Youth Villages as a behavior specialist. It was my work and training with these jobs that provided me important information regarding the abuse, neglect, and delinquent issues that many of the children and families in our community suffer from on a regular basis. </p></div>
                        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto"><p class="large">Upon graduation from law school, I passed the Tennessee Bar Exam and began private practice. I have remained in private practice since 1999 and I primarily handle cases dealing with divorce, custody, child support, orders of protections, the Department of Children's Services, criminal law, and other types of cases that the Putnam County General Sessions Court or Juvenile Court regularly hears. Some of the work that I am most proud of are the adoptions that have become a significant part of my legal practice.</p></div>

                        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto"><p class="large">I have been fortunate over the last several months to have the opportunity to discuss the state of our court system with law-enforcement, court clerks, lawyers, and judges in Putnam County and our surrounding counties. My goals are to make the court more efficient, safer, and to save taxpayer funds.  This may involve procedures that include the use of available technology to handle some inmate issues by video, so that inmates remain secure and in the jail.  Inmate issues may also be addressed earlier in the morning, before court begins for everyone else. Announcements regarding cases will be heard in a timely manner. Fewer and shorter court recesses will be taken, so that the cases will continue to progress faster. I am aware of the amount of time that victims, witnesses, agency representatives, and law-enforcement officers currently spend in court. My goal is to make better use of their time, so that they can get back home, back to work, or get back on the roads to protect our community sooner. As I continue to speak with law-enforcement, court clerks, judges, and other individuals that regularly participate in our court system, I will be able to implement the best ideas and the best suggestions, so that Putnam County has the most efficient General Sessions Court available.</p></div>
